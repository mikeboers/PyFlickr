- fix all the auth helper methods

- tests
- examples
- documentation

- see if a tag is used for more than one context. if not, I can write
  classes for each tag

- better autotypes
    - every node should record what method it was retrieved with and what
      settings
    - should be able to create mappings from tag types to others given the
      context

AutoType
========

The wrapping/auto-loading types should not be extensions of the parsed xml;
they should completely encase it.

Would be nice if the base class had a way of wrapping a list of xml objects which
it will then query in turn for the needed data. This only works if the xpath to
the data is consistent (in meaning).

What are the types I need to build:
	- Blog
	- Collection
	- Comment
	- Contact/User
	- Exif
	- Gallery
	- Group
	- MachineTag
	- Note
	- Panda?
	- Photoset
	- Place

All changes to the objects should be recorded in a work_queue, that is flushed
to the server whenever you call sync().

We can get at existing photos with api.get_photo, or api.get_user(nsid).photosets[0][0]
