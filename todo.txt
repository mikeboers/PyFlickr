AutoType
========

The wrapping/auto-loading types should not be extensions of the parsed xml;
they should completely encase it.

Would be nice if the base class had a way of wrapping a list of xml objects which
it will then query in turn for the needed data. This only works if the xpath to
the data is consistent (in meaning).

What are the types I need to build:
	- Blog
	- Collection
	- Comment
	- Contact/User
	- Exif
	- Gallery
	- Group
	- MachineTag
	- Note
	- Panda?
	- Photoset
	- Place

All changes to the objects should be recorded in a work_queue, that is flushed
to the server whenever you call sync().

We can get at existing photos with api.get_photo, or api.get_user(nsid).photosets[0][0]
